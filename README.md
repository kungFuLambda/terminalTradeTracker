# terminalTradeTracker
## Basics
Tracks all active and past positions in a portfolio. Can open and close positions on terminal and updates every 20 seconds.

### How to run 
Install the requirements with pip (pip(3) install -r requirements.txt
collecter.py [track/add/close], track will track your positions until you exit, add will start a dialog to add a position
and close will start a dialog to close the position.

#### Bugs
probably loads, I just use it as a basic terminal tool because my broker is slow on updating positions
